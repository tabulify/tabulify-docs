====== Data Operation - Truncate ======

===== About =====
''truncate'' is a [[:docs:flow:intermediate|intermediate operation]] that will delete the [[docs:resource:content|content]] of a [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]] but not it's [[docs:resource:metadata|metadata]]


===== Arguments =====

Truncate supports the following [[:docs:flow:argument|arguments]]:

^ Name ^ Default ^ Description ^ 
| ''force'' | ''false'' | Delete the foreign keys constraints if true |
| ''cascade'' | ''false'' | Truncate recursively the [[:docs:resource:dependency|dependent resources]] |
| ''processing-type'' | ''batch'' | The [[:docs:flow:processing-type|processing type]] (all at once or one by one) |

===== Note =====

  * If you want to truncate in a [[:docs:flow:processing-type|stream]] fashion (ie one by one), you should set the ''order'' argument of the [[docs:resource:sql_select|select]] to ''drop'' so that the tables are truncated in order.
  * ''force'' is applied in [[:docs:flow:processing-type|batch]] mode only if all foreign tables are present in the ''batch''.
  * the truncated data resources are returned
  * on a [[:docs:system:file|file system]], ''force'' or ''cascade'' have the same effect, they will truncate all files recursively in a directory.
===== Cli =====

''Truncate'' is also available via the [[docs:tabul:data:truncate|data truncate command]]
