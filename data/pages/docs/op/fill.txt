====== Data Operation - Fill ======


===== About =====
''fill'' is an [[:docs:flow:intermediate|intermediate data operation]] that creates automatically [[:docs:resource:generator|data resource generator]] for its [[:docs:flow:input|inputs]].

When passed to the [[:docs:op:transfer|transfer operation]], you will ''fill'' the defined target.


Optionally, you can define your own [[:docs:resource:generator|generator resource]] with the ''generator-selectors'' arguments to take control over the generated data for a specific resource


===== Cli =====

This ''data operation'' is available via the [[docs:tabul:data:fill|tabul data fill command]] 



===== Arguments =====

The [[:docs:flow:argument|arguments]] are:

^ Name ^ Default ^ Description ^
| ''max-record-count'' | 100 | The [[:docs:resource:generator##maxrecordcount|maximum of record]] generated for generators created by the ''fill'' operation |
| ''generator-selectors'' | | A list of [[:docs:flow:data_selector|data selector]] that selects [[:docs:resource:generator|generator files]] created manually |

===== Note =====

==== Dependent Load: Don't forget to set the order ====

If you want to load [[:docs:resource:dependency|dependent data resources]], you need to set the the ''order'' argument of the [[:docs:op:select|select operation]] to ''create''.

Why? Because the foreign tables needs to be loaded first. 

For instance, when loading a star schema, the dimension needs to be loaded before the fact tables.

==== How are mapped the generator selected? ====

The [[:docs:resource:generator|generator files]] selected with the ''generator-selectors'' are mapped to the [[:docs:flow:input|inputs]]:
  * by their [[docs:resource:logical_name|logical name]] for a multi-fill operation
  * by position for a mono-fill operation (one generator, one target)



**Example:** The generator file name ''d_time-datagen.yml'' would be mapped to a data resource with the [[:docs:resource:logical_name|logical name]] ''d_time''. For instance:
  * the ''d_time.csv'' [[:docs:resource:csv|CSV]]
  * or the ''d_time'' [[docs:resource:sql_table|sql table]]
