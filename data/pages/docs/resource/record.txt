====== Data Resource - Record (Row)======


===== About =====
A ''record'' is the logical unit of a [[docs:resource:tabular|tabular data resource]] (ie a [[docs:resource:tabular|tabular data resource]] is composed of one or more records).


===== Example =====

^ Name ^ Definition ^
| [[docs:resource:sql_table|table]] | the records are ''rows'' |
| [[docs:resource:directory|directory]] | the records are contained [[file|files]] and/or [[directory|directories]] |
| [[:docs:resource:csv|csv]] | the records are lines |

Each data resource has its own logical definition of what a [[record|record]] is.
===== Note =====

==== Count Attribute ====


If the data resource is a [[docs:resource:content|content resource]], the [[count|count attribute]] gives back the number of record that a data resource contains.




==== Pipeline: Change the granularity ====

In a pipeline, you can change the [[:docs:flow:granularity|granularity]] from ''resource'' to ''record'' with the [[:docs:op:split|split operation]]

==== Why Record and not Row? ====

We use the term ''record'' and not ''row'' because it is more generic and refer to data structures in various contexts (files, documents, etc.). 
A ''row'' is the ''record'' of a [[docs:resource:sql_table|table]].
