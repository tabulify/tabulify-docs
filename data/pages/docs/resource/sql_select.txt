====== Data Resource - SQL Select Query ======


===== About =====
A ''SQL Select'' data resource is a [[:docs:resource:sql_dml|SQL DML Request]] that contains a ''SELECT'' statement.

===== Howto =====

  * [[:howto:sql_query:select_query|]]

===== Execution =====


A [[docs:resource:sql_file|SQL file]] containing a ''select'' statement can be executed if it's represented as an [[docs:resource:sql_request|sql request]] (ie SQL [[docs:resource:runtime|runtime data resource uri]])

For instance,
  * for a ''top-5-clients.sql'' select sql file
  * located in the [[:docs:connection:cd|current directory]]
  * that should be executed against a [[:docs:system:sqlite:sqlite|sqlite database]]
The [[docs:resource:runtime|runtime data resource]] ''data uri'' would be:
<code>
(top-5-clients.sql@cd)@sqlite
</code>
===== Attribute =====



^ Name ^ Default ^ Description ^
| ''select-metadata-detections'' | ''describe, temporary-view, false-equality'' | Define a list of [[:docs:system:database:query_metadata_detection|detection methods]] used to capture the structure if not defined via a [[:docs:resource:data-definition|data-definition]] |

All common [[:docs:resource:data-definition|data-definition]] attributes are also allowed ([[docs:resource:column|columns]], ...)



===== Support =====

==== Prepared Statement ====
We support configurable ''select'' statement with [[docs:system:database:sql_parameterized_statement|prepared statements]]


==== How to execute multiple SELECT statements in one script ====

We support as of today, only one ''select'' statement by [[docs:resource:sql_request|SQL Fetch]].

Why? Because a [[docs:resource:request|request]] returns only one resource.

If you want to execute multiple ''SELECT'' statements in one script, you need to use the [[:docs:op:split|split operator]] in a pipeline.
