====== Data Resource - Metadata ======


===== About =====
''metadata'' are ''data'' about the [[resource|data resource]].

''Metadata'' in Tabulify are also known as ''data definition''.

For [[docs:resource:tabular|tabular data]], there is two kind of metadata:
  * scalar - (ie creation date, size, ...)
  * [[structure|data structure]] - (ie column, type, ...)


===== Metadata Store =====

Metadata stores are [[:docs:system:system|system dependent]].


==== File System ====

On [[:docs:system:file|file system]], the metadata definition depends on the [[docs:resource:media-type|file type]].

For a file type that does not store metadata along its data, tabulify uses [[:docs:resource:data-definition|data definition file]].

==== Database ====

In a [[docs:system:database:database|SQL database]], the database has a metadata store and tabulify stores them there.
