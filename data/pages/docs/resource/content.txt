====== Data Resource - Content Resource  ======



===== About =====
A ''content resource'' is a data resource that:
  * contains ''data'' known as [[#static|static data resource]] (for instance, a [[sql_table|sql table]] or a [[file|file]])
  * or returns ''data'' known as [[#runtime|runtime data resource]] (for instance, a [[:docs:resource:sql_select|SQL Query]])


===== Type =====
==== Static ====

A ''static data resource'' is a ''data resource'' where the content is stored on disk in a [[docs:connection:connection|connection]] that can be selected with a [[..:flow:data_selector|data selector]].


The following data operations have impact on the content of stored data resources:
  * [[docs:op:drop|drop]] - drop the resource (delete the resource content included)
  * [[docs:op:truncate|truncate]] - delete the content via metadata update, not the resource
  * [[docs:op:upsert|upsert]] - upsert data into the content
  * [[docs:op:insert|insert]] - insert data into the content
  * [[docs:op:update|update]] - update the content
  * [[docs:op:delete|delete]] - delete parts or all of the content


==== Runtime ====

A ''runtime data resource'' returns its content at runtime (ie the data is not stored but computed).
In tabulify, a runtime data resource is known as a [[docs:resource:runtime|runtime]].


===== Diff =====

Difference in content can been seen via:
  * the [[docs:op:diff|diff operation]]
  * the [[docs:resource:attribute#digest|digest attributes]] such as MD5.
