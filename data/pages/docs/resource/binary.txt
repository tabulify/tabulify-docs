====== Binary File ======


===== About =====
A ''binary'' file is a file that has no known [[:docs:resource:structure|structure]].




It's the default [[:docs:resource:media-type|type]] of file when tabulify cannot detect its [[:docs:resource:structure|structure]].


===== Executable =====

A ''binary executable'' is a  [[:docs:resource:file|file]] that contains machine code instructions that can be directly run by a computer's processor.


^ OS ^ Format ^
| Windows PE | Portable Executable |
| Linux ELF | Executable and Linkable Format | 
| MacOS | Mach-O |

To execute it, you need to represent it as [[command|command]] (ie [[docs:resource:runtime|runtime data resource]])
