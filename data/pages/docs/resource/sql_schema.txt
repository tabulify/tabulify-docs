====== Data Resource - SQL Schema ======

===== About =====
A ''schema'' is a [[:docs:resource:container|container]] [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]] of a [[docs:system:database:database|database]] that contains one or more ''Sql Data Resources'' such as [[sql_table|tables]] or [[sql_view|view]]


===== URI =====
The [[docs:resource:data_uri|Data URI]] that defines a schema has the following form:
<code bash>
# Fully Qualified
catalog.schema.@connection
# With the catalog of the connection if any
schema.@connection
# The default schema of the connection
@connection
</code>
where:
  * ''connection'' is the [[docs:connection:name|connection name]]
  * ''schema'' is the schema name
  * ''catalog'' is the catalog name


<note>
It has the same form as a SQL path form where the object name is the empty string.
</note>
===== How to see the default schema of a connection ? =====


You can see the default schema of your connection with the [[docs:tabul:connection:info|connection info command]].

This is the value set in the [[docs:connection:working_path|working path]]

<code bash>
tabul connection info sqlite
</code>
===== Sample =====
See [[docs:system:sample_schema]]
