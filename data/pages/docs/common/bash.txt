====== Why do we recommend bash ?  ======


===== A propos =====
''Tabulify'' recommends to use a bash based terminal because bash supports to pass simply a URL as parameter whereas Windows ''CMD'' or ''Powershell'' do not.

The Windows ''CMD'' or ''Powershell'' shell see the ''&'' ampersand character of an URL as a special terminal character known as a control operator and split the URL.

===== Example =====

For instance, if you want to copy:
  * the content of the following URL [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&titles=SQL|https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&titles=SQL]]
  * in a CMD/DOS/Powershell terminal
  * with the [[docs:tabul:data:copy|data copy command]]
<code bash>
tabul data copy "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&titles=SQL" sql.xml
</code>
Because of the ''ampersand'', you will get the following error.
<console>
=query was unexpected at this time.
</console>

<note>
  * On ''Windows shell'', the ampersand must be then escaped
  * While the same command line in a ''Bash'' would just run (because Bash creates token (word) of each argument and does not process them any further)
</note>
