====== Execution environment ======


===== About =====
''exec-env'' is a [[docs:conf:attribute|attribute]] that sets the execution environment (ie in production or not).

===== Built-in =====

Tabulify knows the following environments:

^ Name ^ default ^ Description ^
| ''prod'' |  | The production  environment |
| ''dev'' | x | The dev environment |



<note>
[[:docs:op:op|operations]] may react differently depending on it.

To avoid sending emails in a dev environment, the [[docs:op:sendmail|send operation]] will send them all
to the ''to'' address of the smtp connection.
</note>

===== How to set the environment ? =====

You can set the environment :
  * at the command line with the ''--env'' option of tabul.
<code bash>
tabul --exec-env prod
</code>
  * via a [[docs:conf:os|tabul os environment variable]]
<code bash>
export TABUL_EXEC_ENV=prod
</code>



===== How to see the environment =====

With the ''env'' variable.

Example:
<unit>
<code bash>
tabul env list EXEC_ENV
</code>
<console>
attribute   value   origin           description
---------   -----   --------------   -------------------------
EXEC_ENV    dev     Os environment   The execution environment
</console>
</unit>
