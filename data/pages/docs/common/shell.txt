====== Tabulify - CMD/Powershell Shell ======


===== Information =====
''Tabulify'' supports the ''CMD'' and ''Powershell'' shell but be aware that when using them, you will encounter problem if you are passing an [[docs:resource:uri|URI/URL]] as argument with the [[docs:tabul:data:start|tabul data command]]. See [[bash#why_do_we_recommend_bash|Why we recommend bash]]

===== Configuration =====

==== Terminal Width Size ====

Set the width size of you terminal to a big enough number. We recommend 9000.

When [[docs:tabul:env:list|listing some configuration]], you may get a lengthy output (such as a list of a path) and the output will then not render nicely.

To avoid this inconvenient, our advice is to increase the width size of your terminal.

Example with ''Cmd'':
  * Top-Left corner > Properties > Layout
