====== Collation Support ======


===== About =====

The ''collation'' determines how the database engine compares, sorts, and matches text data of a column.

''collation'' is not yet a managed metadata. Tabulify don't know the column collation.

===== Impact =====

This has an impact on the [[:docs:generator:sequence|sequence generator]] for character data. 

By default, the generated data does not include uppercase letter to have true unique value for case-insensitive collation.

Why?

With a case-insensitive collation (The default of [[:docs:system:sqlserver:sqlserver|SQL Server]], ie `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS`):
  * ''A'' would be equals to ''a''
  * ''Hello'' would be equals to ''HELLO''

And the generated would not be truly unique in the sequence.
