====== Regular Expression Generator ======


===== About =====
''regexp'' is a [[:docs:generator:data-supplier|data supplier]] that generates data based on a regular expression.

===== Example =====

  * [[:howto:generator:regexp_number]]

===== Example =====

Generation of a decimal that has:
  * 3 digits in the integral part
  * 3 digits in the fractional part
thanks to the regular expression ''%%[0-9]{3}\.[0-9]{3}%%''

<file yml generator/regexp--generator.yml>

===== Arguments =====

==== Expression ====

''expression'' is a [[kb>lang:regexp:regexp|regular expression]] that defines the pattern of the data that should be generated.

The following table shows the supported syntax:

==== Seed ====

''seed'' is optional. It's a [[kb>seed|start point in the generation of pseudo-random numbers]].

If set the data will be deterministic between executions.
