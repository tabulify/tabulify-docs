====== Connection - Password Attribute ======


===== Password =====
A ''password'' is a [[attribute|connection attribute]] that permits to identify the user.


===== How to set it? =====

If you want to set the connection password for the connection name ''postgres'', you can
set it on Linux as [[:docs:conf:os|environment variable]]:

<code bash>
export TABUL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=xxx
# ie export TABUL_connectionNAME_PASSWORD=xxx
</code>

You can even [[:docs:tabul:vault:encrypt|encrypt the value]].

To be more explicit or if you want to use another name, you can set it in the [[docs:conf:tabul.yml|configuration vault file]]:

<code yaml>
connections:
  postgres:
     password: ${YOUR_PASSWORD}
</code>
