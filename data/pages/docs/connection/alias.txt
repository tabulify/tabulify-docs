====== Alias Connection ======



===== About =====
An ''alias'' connection permits to create a relative connection from an existing one..


===== Example =====

In this scenario, you want to refer to the directory ''pipeline@app'' via ''@pipeline''

ie you have stored your [[:docs:flow:pipeline|pipeline]] in a subdirectory of the [[:docs:connection:app|app directory]] called ''pipeline''  and you don't want to use
<code>
pipeline/01-pipeline@app
</code>
but you want to use
<code>
01-pipeline@pipeline
</code>

In your [[docs:conf:tabul.yml|configuration vault]], you would add the following ''pipeline'' connection
<file yml>
connections:
  pipeline:
    uri: 'alias:pipeline@app'
</file>


===== URI Syntax =====

You can create alias connection with the following [[:docs:connection:uri|URI]]:
<code>
alias:path@connection-name
</code>
