====== System Connection - Md (Manifest Directory) ======


===== About =====

The ''md'' [[connection|connection]] is a [[built-in|built-in connection]] that points to the [[docs:resource:directory|directory]] of the [[:docs:common:manifest|manifest]].


You use them in a [[docs:resource:data_uri|data-uri]] to locate data resource that are sibling of the manifest.

===== Example =====

In a [[:docs:resource:manifest|resource]] manifest, if your ''books.csv'' [[docs:resource:csv|csv file]] is in the same directory, you would use ''books.csv@md'' as [[:docs:resource:data_uri|data uri]]

Example:
<code yaml>
kind: csv
spec:
  data-uri: books.csv@md
</code>
