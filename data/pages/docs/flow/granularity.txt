====== Step Granularity (Grain) ======


===== About =====
''granularity'' is a operation argument that sets the granularity of the execution.

If the value is:
  * ''resource'', the operation is performed on each [[:docs:resource:resource|resource]]
  * ''record'', the operation is performed on each [[:docs:resource:record|record]] of the resource



===== Example =====

==== Split ====

The [[:docs:op:split|split operation]] permits to split data resource into data resources.

  * In a ''record'' granularity, it will create a data resource by record
  * In a ''resource'' granularity, it will create multiple data resource by data resource


==== Sendmail ====

The [[:docs:op:sendmail|sendmail operation]] will:

  * In a ''record'' granularity, send an email by record
  * In a ''resource'' granularity, send the resource as attachment
