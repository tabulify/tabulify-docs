====== Pipeline Step ======


===== Step =====
A ''step'' (''operation step'') is an element of a [[docs:flow:pipeline|pipeline]] that executes a [[docs:op:op|data operation]].


===== Syntax =====

The syntax of steps in a [[docs:flow:pipeline|pipeline manifest]] is the following:
<code yaml>
kind: pipeline
spec:
  # a list of steps
  steps:
        # the name of the operation to perform
      - operation: "firstSupplierOperationName"
        # The arguments to pass to the operation
        args:
            arg1:  value1 # the first argument
            arg2:  value2 # the second argument
            ....
            argN:  valueN # the Nieme argument
        # An optional name (identifier that should not contains any space)
        # Default to step + id in the list
        name: "name"
        # An optional comment
        comment: "A long or short command/description of the step"
      - operation: "secondIntermediateOperationName"
        ....
</code>


===== Type =====

There is 2 type of steps:
  * [[docs:flow:supplier|supplier step]] - the first step in a pipeline that supplies the pipeline in data resources
  * [[docs:flow:intermediate|intermediate step]] - the next steps in a pipeline that transform the data resources stream
