====== Data Resource - Runtime Selector ======


===== About =====
[[docs:resource:runtime|Runtime resources]] (such as [[..:resource:request|request]] and [[..:resource:script|script]]) can be selected in a [[:docs:op:select|select operation]] with an ''runtime selector''.


===== Syntax =====

A ''runtime selector'' is a [[..:flow:data_selector|data selector]] with an extra connection known as the execution connection.


The syntax is:
<code>
(globPattern@executableConnection)@executionConnection
</code>
where:
  * ''globPattern@executableConnection'' is [[:docs:flow:data_selector|data selector]] that selects the [[:docs:resource:file|file data resources]] (known also as the ''executable'')
  * and the second  part defines the [[docs:connection:connection|connection]] where the ''executable'' is executed
