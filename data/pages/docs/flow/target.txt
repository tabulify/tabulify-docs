====== Flow - Target ======


===== About =====
The ''target'' is a [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]] that is the counterpart of an [[:docs:flow:input|input]] in an operation.



The target can be used as [[:docs:flow:output|output]] of an operation.







===== Example =====

==== Transfer ====

In every [[docs:op:transfer|transfer operation]], the ''target-data-uri'' defines where the data should be stored

Note:
  * if the defined target does not exist, it will be created
  * one of the following ''target operation'' can be executed before transfer:
      * ''drop''
      * ''truncate''
  * The ''target operation'' in ''tabul'' is set with the ''target-operation'' [[docs:tabul:option|option]]


==== Diff ====

==== Create ====

In a [[:docs:op:create|create operation]], the ''targets'' represents the created data resources from the input.

==== Execute ====

In the [[:docs:op:execute|execute operation]], the ''targets'' represents the created resources.
