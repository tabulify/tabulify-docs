====== Stream Pipeline ======


===== About =====

A ''stream pipeline'' is a [[:docs:flow:pipeline|pipeline]] that has a [[docs:flow:supplier|supplier operation]] with a [[:docs:flow:processing-type|processing type]] set to ''stream''.


===== Data Processing =====

A ''stream pipeline'' will:
  * [[#poll]] a [[:docs:flow:supplier|supplier]] at interval 
  * send the data resource [[docs:flow:intermediate|down stream]] immediately or at interval (''push-interval'')
  * executes:
    * [[docs:flow:processing-type|stream intermediate operation]] immediately
    * [[docs:flow:processing-type|batch intermediate operation]] at interval (''window-interval'')


==== Poll ====


  * The polling happens when:
    * there is no data resource anymore in the queue
    * the interval determined by the [[#argument|poll-interval argument]] is exhausted
  * The number of polling is stored in the [[docs:flow:pipeline#metrics|poll counter metrics]]
===== Arguments =====

Every stream [[pipeline|pipeline]] accepts the following arguments:

^ Name ^ Default ^ Description ^
| ''poll-interval'' | ''1s'' | The [[docs:common:duration|interval]] between poll (a poll is a request for data resources) |
| ''push-interval'' | | The [[docs:common:duration|interval ]] between push (a push is the sending of a data resource into the pipeline) |
| ''window-interval'' | ''2s'' | The [[docs:common:duration|interval]] between execution of [[docs:flow:processing-type|batch]] [[docs:flow:intermediate|intermediate operation]] \\ (generally known as the window) \\ The first execution will be at pipeline start time + window interval |

===== End =====

A stream is not meant to end but you can use the [[docs:flow:pipeline#duration control|duration control argument]] in your [[docs:app:test|tests]].
