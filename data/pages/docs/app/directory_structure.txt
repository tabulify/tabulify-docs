====== Directory structure  ======


===== About =====
''Tabulify'' does not enforce any directory structure.

Inside an app directory, you can define the structure that fits your needs.

For instance:
  * a pipeline directory
  * a data directory
  * ..

===== Tip: Alias Connection to create a structure =====

To reference subdirectories directories, you can create specific directory connection relative to the [[:docs:connection:app|app home]] with an [[:docs:connection:alias|alias connection]].

Example of a pipeline connection in the [[docs:conf:tabul.yml|configuration vault]] for a ''pipeline'' subdirectory in the [[:docs:connection:app|app connection]]
<code yml>
connections:
  pipeline:
   uri: alias:pipeline@app
