====== Tabulify - App ======


===== About  =====
A ''app'' is a directory where the [[docs:conf:tabul.yml|configuration vault]] is located.

When present, the [[:docs:connection:connection#default|default connection]] is the [[docs:connection:app|app connection (ie app home)]]

It groups the following artifactory:
  * [[docs:resource:resource|resource]] ([[docs:resource:file|file]], [[docs:resource:runtime]], ...)
  * [[docs:flow:pipeline|pipeline]] - data processing pipeline



Typically, ''Tabulify'' apps are stored in a version control system such as Git and are hooked to a Continuous Integration system that deploy to [[:docs:common:environment|target environment]] such as production or test.
