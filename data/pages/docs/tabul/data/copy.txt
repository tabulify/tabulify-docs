====== Tabul - Data Copy Command ======


===== About =====
''data copy'' is a [[docs:tabul:command|command]] that supports the [[docs:op:copy|copy operation]].

<note>
It's just an alias of the [[transfer|transfer command]] where the [[docs:op:transfer#operation|transfer operation]] has the value ''copy''.
</note>



===== Prerequisites =====
A [[docs:op:copy|copy]] operation creates a [[docs:flow:target|target data resource]] that is a ''copy'' of the [[docs:flow:source|source data resource]] meaning that
 they should have the same:
  * [[docs:resource:structure|structure]]
  * [[docs:resource:count|number of rows]]

Therefore if the [[docs:flow:target|target data resource]] exists:
  * the [[docs:flow:target|target data resource]] should have the same [[docs:resource:structure|structure]] than the [[docs:flow:source|source data resource]]
  * or you set the ''target-operation'' to ''replace''
  * the [[docs:flow:target|target data resource]] should be empty
  * or you set the ''target-operation'' to ''truncate''
===== Syntax =====

Tabul data copy
===============

Copy one or more data resources.

Note: This is an alias command to the `transfer` command with the `copy` transfer operation.



Examples
--------

 1 - To copy the table `time` from the data store `sqlite` into the file `time.csv`, you would execute


        tabul data copy time@sqlite time.csv


 2 - To copy the file `foo.txt` to the file `foo_copy.txt`, you would execute


        tabul data copy foo.txt foo_copy.txt




Syntax
------


    tabul data copy [options|flags] <source-selector...> <target-data-uri>


where:


  Arguments:

    <source-selector...>                                          A data selector that select the data resources to transfer

    <target-data-uri>                                             A target data uri (Example: table@connection or foo.csv@cd)


  Cross Data Transfer Options:

    -bs,--buffer-size <buffer-size>                               defines the size of the memory buffer between the source and target threads

    -mdu,--metrics-data-uri <metrics-data-uri>                    defines a target data uri where the data metrics should be exported

    -out,--output-type <output-type>                              The resource that is passed as output

    -pt,--processing-type <processing-type>                       how to process the inputs (one by one or in batch)

    -sfs,--source-fetch-size <source-fetch-size>                  defines the size of the network message from the source to fetch the data

    -so,--source-operation <source-operation>                     defines the data operation (drop or truncate) on the source after transfer. Note: A `move` operation will drop the source.

    -to,--target-operation <target-operation>                     defines the data operations (drop or truncate) on the existing target before transfer. A `replace` operation will drop the target.
