===== About =====

''Templating'' is the process of transforming a [[template|template]] into a [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]] (ie document).

This process is executed by a [[engine|template engine]].




===== Template Operation =====

When applying ''values'' of a [[docs:flow:source|source data resource]] to the [[template|template]] via the [[docs:op:template|template operation]], a new [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]] is created by replacing the ''variable name'' by their respective ''value'' and executing optionally logical transformation.
