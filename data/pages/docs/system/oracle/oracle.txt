===== Connection =====

[[howto:oracle:create_connection|]]
===== Version =====

The [[https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html|driver version]] used is the ''23.7.0.25.01''


===== Parameters =====

==== Quoted identifier is disabled by default ====

We disable quoted identifier by setting by default the [[docs:system:database:connection_attributes#NAME QUOTING ENABLED|NAME_QUOTING_ENABLED]] parameter to false for Oracle.

Why ? 
  * Because it requires you to put always the quotation mark even in a `SQL SELECT` which is crazy. 
  * You can't write `select cat_id`, you need to write `select "cat_id"`
  * Why it requires it? The quotes are part of the `name` and are not an escape feature, meaning that when you get the table name, you don't get `cat_id`, you get `"cat_id"`

<blockquote>
If you name a schema object using a quoted identifier, then you must use the double quotation marks whenever you refer to that object.
