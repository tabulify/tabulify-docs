====== Local File System ======


===== About =====
The ''local file system'' is the [[file|file system]] of the operation system where ''Tabulify'' is installed.

This is the [[file|file system]]:
  * of your computer
  * or/of the ''Tabulify'' server
depending on where the ''Tabulify'' is running.

===== Built-in Connection =====
''Tabulify'' comes with the below [[docs:connection:built-in|built-in connection]] to the local file system:
  * [[docs:connection:cd|cd]] - the current directory
  * [[docs:connection:tmp|temp]] - the temporary directory
  * [[docs:connection:desktop|desktop]] -  the user desktop directory of the local file system
  * [[docs:connection:home|home]] -  the user home directory of the local file system
  * [[docs:connection:md|sd]] - the script directory actually running
  * [[docs:connection:app|app]] - the app home directory


===== URL =====

To create a local file connection, you can use one of the following [[docs:connection:uri|URL]]:
  * the local file URL to define a absolute path
  * a [[#data uri|data uri]] to define a relative path

==== Local file URI ====


<code uri>
file://path
</code>
where:
  * the ''path'' should be absolute. It should start with:
      *  ''/'' for linux
      * ''%%/C://%%'', ''%%/D://%%'', .. for windows

Example:
  * Windows
<code url>
file:///C:/Users/username/
</code>
  * Linux
<code url>
file:///opt/
</code>

<note important>
You can't define a relative path. You cannot used as start character:
  * ''.'' for the working directory
  * and ''..'' for the parent
You need to use the [[#data uri|data uri syntax]] to define a relative path
</note>


==== Data Uri ====
To define a relative path, you can use a [[docs:resource:data_uri|data uri]] with a [[#|built-in local data connection]]

Example: to target the build directory inside the  [[docs:connection:app|app home connection directory]]
<code url>
data-uri:build@app
</code>
