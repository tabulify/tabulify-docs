====== HTTP System (The Web) ======


===== About =====
''http'' is a system of URL.

A URL when requested returns a [[docs:resource:request|response resource]]  (document) with a [[docs:resource:media-type|media type]].


===== Characteristic =====

As a [[file|file system]]:
  * a document can be seen as a file with its URL as path.
  * ''http'' does not have the notion of directory and therefore cannot be traversed as a file tree system, therefore the [[howto:tabul:glob|glob selections]] are not available.
  * A URL has a hierarchical structure where we can give a parent to a document.


===== Configuration =====

==== User-Agent ====

Due to a lot of website blocking normal user agent, Tabulify uses know `curl/8.13.0` as default
