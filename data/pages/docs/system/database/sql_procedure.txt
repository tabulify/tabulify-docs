====== SQL Procedure ======


===== About =====
A ''SQL Procedure'' is a [[docs:system:database:database|database]] unit of execution written in a ''procedural language (PL)'' designed to embrace ''SQL'' statements within its syntax.



===== Type =====

Tabulify supports the 2 kind of procedures:
  * a [[:docs:resource:sql_stored_procedure|stored procedure]] (ie stored in the database)
  * a [[:docs:resource:sql_anonymous_block|anonymous block procedure]] (ie written in a SQL script)


===== Syntax =====

The procedural language syntax is database dependent and is generally designed to embrace SQL statements within its syntax.

The body can be:
  * a simple statement such as ''SELECT'' or ''INSERT'', 
  * or a block statement written using ''BEGIN'' and ''END''. block statements can contain 
    * declarations, 
    * loops, 
    * and other control structure statements.
