<icon name="logos:sqlite" width="280" float="right"/>
===== About =====
''Tabulify'' supports the [[https://www.sqlite.org/index.html|sqlite]] [[docs:system:database:database|relational database]] as a [[docs:system:system|system]]

<note>
If you don't have any knowledge of ''Tabulify'', you can start with the [[howto:getting_started:getting_started|Learning Guide]].
</note>


===== Connection =====

See [[howto:sqlite:create]]

===== Driver =====
The driver used is the [[https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc|Xerial one]]

===== Table Size =====

Table [[:docs:resource:size|size]] is determined with the following query against [[https://www.sqlite.org/dbstat.html|dbstat]]
<code sql>
SELECT SUM("pgsize") FROM "dbstat" WHERE name='table_name'
</code>
===== Support =====

==== Data Type ====

See [[datatype]]


==== SQLite does not support the creation and drop of constraints in the alter statement (primary, unique and foreign key) ====

Unfortunately, SQLite does not support the creation and dropping of constraints [[https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html|in the alter table statement]].

Therefore, you can't drop any primary key, unique key and foreign keys once the tables have been created.

You need to:
  * [[:howto:sql_schema:create_table_with_dependencies|create a new schema]]
  * and to copy or move the data

We still support the constraint creation with the `CREATE TABLE` statement.


==== LowerCase Table Name ====

Table names are lowercase normalized by SQLite, not by Tabulify. The column names are not.




<code sql>
create table FOO (bar char);
-- is equivalent to 
create table foo (bar char);
-- but not to
create table foo (BAR char);
</code>
The second statement will result in the following error:
<console>
[SQLITE_ERROR] SQL error or missing database (table foo already exists)
</console>
