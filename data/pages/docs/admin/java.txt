====== Java Environment ======


===== About =====

We build and test Tabulify with Java 17 Temurin.


When installing with a packager:
  * we install as dependency OpenJDK with brew
  * we deliver the required [[#modules]] on windows with winget

===== Modules =====

Tabulify needs the following modules:
  * `jdk.crypto.ec`: mandatory to avoid handshake_failure on http request
  * `java.desktop`: for java/awt colors
  * `jdk.compiler`: required by the Javascript runtime (Rhino)
  * `jdk.dynalink`: required by the Javascript runtime (Rhino)
  * `jdk.zipfs`: for archive format (jar)


===== Support =====

==== java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: jdk/dynalink/RelinkableCallSite ====


Using the [[:docs:generator:generator|data generator]], you may get the following error:
<code>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: jdk/dynalink/RelinkableCallSite
        at org.mozilla.javascript.optimizer.BodyCodegen.addDynamicInvoke(BodyCodegen.java:4598)
</code>


Why? The code is generated and needs the jdk modules `jdk.dynalink` and `jdk.compiler`

Check that your java machine has the required modules
```bash
java --list-modules | grep jdk.dynalink
```

If you have installed tabulify with a `nojre` archive, you need to be sure that the java virtual machine used in your computer is at minimum JDK 17.

```bash
java --version
```
Example:
```
openjdk 17.0.16 2025-07-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.16+8 (build 17.0.16+8)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.16+8 (build 17.0.16+8, mixed mode, sharing)
```

If this is not the case, you need to :
  * install a JDK or make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable point to it
  * reinstall Tabulify with a `jre` archive where the modules are present.

If you use a package manager such as `brew` to install Tabulify, you should not have this error. [[:contact|Contact us]] if this is the case.
