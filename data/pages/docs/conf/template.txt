====== Template Variables ======


===== About =====
[[docs:conf:attribute|Attributes]] can be used at several place as ''template variable''.


For instance, in:
  * [[docs:conf:tabul.yml|a configuration vault]]
  * [[:docs:flow:pipeline|pipeline file]]
  * [[docs:resource:logical_name|logical name]] definition
  * [[docs:flow:template_string|target template]] definition


You can see the attributes that you can use:
  * for a connection with the [[:docs:tabul:connection:info|connection info command]]
  * for a resource with the [[docs:tabul:data:info|data info command]]
  * globally with the [[docs:tabul:env:list|attribute list command]]


===== Example =====

If you want a file to take as [[docs:resource:logical_name|logical name]] a part of its name, you can use [[:docs:common:globbing|back-reference globbing variables]] when you [[:docs:op:select|select]] them.

  * If you have an export file with an obscure identifier such as:
<file>
cleaned_members_export_d874afd3b7.csv
</file>
  * If you select this file with the [[:docs:common:globbing|glob selector]] ''*_export_*.csv''
  * You can set its logical name to ''cleaned_members'' by setting the logical name to ''%%$1%%''.
