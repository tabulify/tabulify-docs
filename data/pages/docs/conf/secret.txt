===== About =====

''Secrets'' are a piece of information that you don't want to be visible in clear in your code or to leak in any way (log, console, ...)

The most known secret are tokens that represents a credential in order to log in to a [[docs:system:system|system]]:
  * [[docs:connection:password|password]]
  * [[:docs:common:passphrase|passphrase]]
  * api key

To enhance secrecy you may also want to cache other information such as the location of you system (host, port,...)
