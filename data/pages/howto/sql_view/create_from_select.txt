====== How to create a SQL View with a SELECT query ======


===== About =====

This ''howto'' shows you how to create  [[docs:resource:sql_view|sql views]] with [[docs:resource:sql_select|select query]] stored in [[docs:resource:sql_file|SQL file]]

===== How to create one view from one query =====

==== The Select Query ====

We are going to use the [[:docs:connection:tpcds_query|tpcds]] ''query_11.sql'' to create this view.

<unit>
<code bash>
tabul data print --type text sqlite/query_11.sql@tpcds_query

</console>
</unit>

==== The creation ====

<unit display="none">
Drop the view and all existing if they exists
<code bash>
tabul data drop --no-strict-selection *@sqlite
</code>
</unit>

With the [[:docs:tabul:data:create|tabul create]] command, to create view called ''query_11'' from the ''query_11.sql'' file, you would execute the following command:
<unit>
<code bash>
tabul data create \
   --target-attribute media-type=view \
   sqlite/query_11.sql@tpcds_query  \
   @sqlite
</code>
where:
  * ''--target-attribute media-type=view'' specifies the [[docs:resource:media-type|media type]] as [[docs:resource:sql_view|view]].
    * It means that we want to create a sql view and not a [[docs:resource:sql_table|sql table]] (the default, for the [[:docs:op:create|create operation]] in a relational system)
  * ''sqlite/query_11.sql@tpcds_query'' is a [[docs:flow:data_selector|data selector]] that selects the ''query_11.sql'' [[:docs:connection:tpcds_query|tpcds]] [[docs:resource:sql_file|sql file]]  as [[:docs:flow:source|source]]
  * ''@sqlite'' select the [[howto:sqlite:howto_connection|sql howto connection]] as [[:docs:flow:target|target]]

Output:
<console>
Results of the create operation
input                             target
-------------------------------   ---------------
sqlite/query_11.sql@tpcds_query   query_11@sqlite
</console>
</unit>

===== How to create multiple views from multiple SQL files? =====

==== The Create command ====

Because Tabulify is capable to process multiple files at once, we can also create for all [[:docs:connection:tpcds_query|TpcsDs query]], a view.

<unit>
<code bash>
tabul data create \
   --target-attribute media-type=view \
   sqlite/*.sql@tpcds_query  \
   'tpcds_$1@sqlite'
# single quotes around the tpcds_$1@sqlite are mandatory so that bash will not see $1 as a environment variable
</code>
where:
  * ''sqlite/*.sql@tpcds_query'' is a [[docs:flow:data_selector|data selector]] that:
    * selects all [[docs:resource:sql_file|sql files]] thanks to the [[:howto:tabul:glob|star (glob expression)]]
    * in the ''sqlite'' directory of the [[:docs:connection:tpcds_query|tpcds query directory]]
    * as [[:docs:flow:source|source]]
  * ''%%tpcds_$1@sqlite%%'' is a [[docs:flow:template_data_uri|target uri]] that will:
      * create for each source,
      * a target with a name that:
         * starts with ''tpcds_''
         * followed by the first matching part (''%%$1%%'') of the [[:howto:tabul:glob|star (glob expression)]]
      * as [[:docs:flow:target|target]]
</unit>

==== Listing the views ====

With the [[:docs:tabul:data:list|data list command]], we can see all of them as been created:

<unit>
<code bash>
tabul data list *@sqlite
