====== Tabulify - How to generate a sequence based on provided values ======

===== About =====
This [[..:howto|how-to]] shows you how to generate a <icon name="ant-design:ordered-list-outlined" /> [[docs:generator:sequence|sequence]] based on provided values with the [[docs:generator:sequence|column sequence generator]].

This page demonstrate the ''values'' and ''reset'' property of the [[docs:generator:sequence|column sequence generator]].

The sequence will be created with a list of colors.

===== Steps =====

==== Creation of the generator file ====
To generate data, you need to create a [[docs:resource:generator|generator file]] that will describe the data to be generated.

The below [[docs:resource:generator|data resource generator]]:
  * has the [[docs:resource:name|name]] ''sequence_color--generator.yml''
  * has the [[docs:resource:logical_name|logical name]] ''sequence_color''
  * will generate ''10'' values (''MaxRecordCount'' count)
  * has a column named ''id'' that has [[docs:generator:sequence|sequence data generator]] that:
      * starts by default at the value ''1''
      * increments by default with the value ''1''
  * has a column named ''seq_color'' with the ''varchar'' data type (default) that has [[docs:generator:sequence|sequence data generator]] that:
      * will reset (restart from the first value when the last is reached)
      * will return the color values provided in the ''values'' property.

<unit>
<file yaml sequence_color--generator.yml>
kind: generator
spec:
  MaxRecordCount: 10
  Columns:
    - name: id
      type: integer
      comment: A id column to see easily the number of values generated
      data-supplier:
        type: sequence
    - name: seq_color
      type: varchar
      comment: A column with a color sequence date generator
      data-supplier:
        type: sequence
        arguments:
          # when the last color has been given (black), restart from the first element (blue)
          reset: true
          # the list of values returned in sequence
          values:
            - blue
            - red
            - green
            - cyan
            - magenta
            - yellow
            - black



</file>
</unit>
==== Printing the data ====

With the [[docs:tabul:data:print|data print command]], we can print the ''values'' generated.
<unit>
<code bash>
tabul data print sequence_color--generator.yml@howto
</code>
<note tip>
[[docs:connection:howto|howto]] is the connection that contains the files used in the [[..:howto|HowTo's]].
</note>
<console>
id   seq_color
--   ---------
 1   blue
 2   red
 3   green
 4   cyan
 5   magenta
 6   yellow
 7   black
 8   blue
 9   red
10   green
</console>
</unit>

Because a [[docs:resource:generator|generator]] is just a [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]], you can use it in every [[docs:op:op|data operation]].
