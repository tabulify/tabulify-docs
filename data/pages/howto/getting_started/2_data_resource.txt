====== Learning Tabulify - Step 2 - What's a Data Resource ? ======


===== Data Resources =====

The first job of a data processing platform such as ''Tabulify'' is to work with ''data''.

''Tabulify'' calls, locates and knows all ''data'' uniformly under the term ''Data Resource''.

  * A [[docs:resource:file|file]] is a ''data resource''
  * A [[docs:resource:directory|directory]] is a ''data resource''
  * A [[docs:resource:uri|url]] is a ''data resource''
  * A [[docs:resource:sql_table|database table]] is a ''data resource''
  * A [[docs:resource:sql_schema|database schema]] is a ''data resource''


<note important>
=== Innovate - Everything is a file ===

On the ''Tabulify'' platform, all data are uniformly named and manipulated as ''Data Resource''.

It means that you can copy a ''csv'' file into a database ''table'' and vice-versa with the same ''command'' as if you were copying a ''file'' to another ''directory'', following the [[wp>Everything_is_a_file|Everything is a file mantra]].
</note>


===== List =====

The ''Tabulify'' platform supports a lot of different ''data resources'' that you can discover in the [[docs:resource:resource|data resources page]].




===== Next =====

The ''data resources'' are stored in [[docs:system:system|systems]] that we can reach via a connection.
