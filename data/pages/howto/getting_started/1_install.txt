====== Learning Tabulify - Step 1 - Installation ======


===== Tabul =====
To learn ''Tabulify'', you need to install the [[docs:tabul:tabul|Tabul command line tool]].

This pages will guide you through the installation steps.

===== Steps =====

==== Prerequisites ====
''Tabulify'' relies on ''Java'' version ''1.8''

You should have therefore already a ''java'' installation from and above ''1.8''

You can check it by calling the below command
<code>
java -version
</code>
<console>
java version "1.8.0_251"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_251-b08)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.251-b08, mixed mode)
</console>

<note>
If this is not the case, you can download it and install it at the [[https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html|Java download page]]
</note>




==== Installation Directory ====


Create a directory called the [[docs:tabul:home|Tabulify Home]] where you will unzip the content of the installation file. <inote>A path without space is recommended</inote>

  * Windows
<code bash>
:: Below c:\tabulify is the Tabulify Home.
mkdir c:\tabulify
</code>
  * Linux / Mac
<code bash>
# Below /opt/tabulify is the Tabulify Home.
mkdir /opt/tabulify
</code>

==== Download ====
You need to [[https://tabulify.com/tabulify.zip]] download the zipped file for your operating system.

''Tabulify'' is distributed for different operation system.





==== Unzip ====
Unzip the downloaded file into the [[docs:tabul:home|Tabulify Home]]

At the command line:
  * Windows
<code bash>
unzip tabulify.zip -d c:\tabulify
</code>
  * Linux
<code bash>
unzip tabulify.zip -d /opt/tabulify
</code>
==== Symlink ====

  * Optionally, create a symlink into your bin directory to be able to call [[docs:tabul:tabul|Tabulify]] from everywhere.
<code bash>
mklink c:\tabulify\tabul.cmd %USERPROFILE%\bin\tabul.cmd
</code>
  * This local ''bin'' directory should be added to the ''PATH'' environment variable.
<code bash>
setx PATH=%PATH%,%USERPROFILE%\bin
</code>

===== Tabul =====
If you can call the ''tabul'' command line, your installation is validated.

[[docs:tabul:tabul|Tabul]] is the command line tool of ''Tabulify'' and is composed of [[docs:tabul:module|module]] that regroups [[docs:tabul:command|command]] where each command can be customized with ''argument'' and [[docs:tabul:option|options]].

  * Open a console
  * Call [[docs:tabul:tabul|tabul]] with the ''help'' option
<unit>
<code bash>
tabul --help
# or if you didn't have the directory in your PATH environment variable
# TABULIFY_HOME\bin\tabul --help
</code>
  * The [[docs:tabul:help|help]] should shows up.
<console>

===== Terminal =====


''Tabulify'' supports a lot of command line in the [[docs:tabul:data:start|tabul data module]] and having a good terminal that simplify our task is important.

We recommend therefore a terminal that supports bash.

See [[docs:common:bash]]
